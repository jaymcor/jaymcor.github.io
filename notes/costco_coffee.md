# Notes: Costco Coffee Beans

## General Advice

I'm not an expert, but some common opinions:

* Freshness matters a lot.
* Grind your own beans--it takes only a moment.
* When the vendor says "blend" it really means "random, whatever's cheapest".
* It's generally better if they give source details.
* "Dark roast" is over-rated, but vendors like it because consistent.

## Provisos

This document is meant to boost my own memory, but might be helpful
to somebody else.  No guarantee we would agree on taste.

I don't like dark roast coffee, so not exploring that territory much.
