# Notes on Coffee Beans at Costco

## General Advice

I'm not an expert, but some themes emerge from expert opinions:

* Freshness matters a lot
* Grind your own beans--it takes only a moment and it's fresher
* When the vendor says "blend" it really means "random, whatever's cheapest"
* It's generally better if they give source details
* "Dark roast" is over-rated, but vendors like it because consistent

## Provisos

This document is mostly meant to boost my own memory, but maybe helpful
to somebody else, though there's no guarantee we would agree on taste.

I don't like dark roasted coffee, so haven't tried many of them.

* Dark roast--very much so.
* It was on sale. Never again.
* If you have to use it, use it for cold brew.
