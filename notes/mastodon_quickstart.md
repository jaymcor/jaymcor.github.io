# Streamlined Mastodon Quickstart

There's not much to it, just:

1. Choose a server
2. Setup your profile
3. Follow some accounts or topics
4. Write some things
5. Boost some things
6. Repeat steps 3-6

------------------------------------------------------------------

## Right platform?

* Focusing here on *Mastodon*
  * Most active platform in fediverse
  * Public discourse through short messages

#### Other options

* *PixelFed*: picture feeds
* *WriteFreely*: longer blog posts
* lots more interoperating in fediverse

------------------------------------------------------------------

## Choosing a server/community

* you don't need to run your own server
  * unless you want to--not covered here
* best bet: *just use the same server as your friends*
* doesn't matter much which server you choose
  * you can communicate with anybody

### Considerations

* Up-to-date software version
* Big&stable vs small&nimble
* Server responsiveness
* Moderator responsiveness
* Max post text length (varies, often 500 chars)
* Local code of conduct
* Language
* Communities
  * based on fields and interests
  * based on identity
  * based on location

### Checking out a server

* Load the server's home page and click the "Local" feed link (or append `/public/local`)
  * There's at least something going on, right?
  * Evaluate the content subjectively...
  * Can you see a few interesting random posts lying around?
  * Comfortable neighborhood?  What kind of people?
  * Right level of friendliness, intellectualism, etc?
* Read the server's about page (click about on lower left or append `/about`)
  * *Important*: can you abide the *code of conduct*?
  * Do the server rules offer the protections you want?
  * Do the server rules offer the freedoms you want?
  * Sanity check moderated servers list...
    * Are there people you want to follow that would be filtered?

------------------------------------------------------------------

## Setting up an account

#### Create an account

* Use the "Create" or "Sign up" button on the server home page.
  * In some cases it's immediate
  * In other cases you have to go through hoops e.g. email ping.
* Add profile pic
* Add sufficient info for disambiguation
* Add whatever personal info you wish to divulge
  * Abilities?
  * Sensitivities?
  * Proclivities?
  * Location?
  * Profession?
* Add links to websites

#### Post an introduction

It is common convention to introduce yourself via a post:

* Use the `#introduction` hashtag
* Synopsis of personal info on your profile
* What sort of posts to expect from you
* Some exciting hook to convince people to follow you?
  * An interesting picture might help

#### Let your contacts know your handle

* `@me@some.server` in text, `https://some.server/@me` in link
  * e.g. [@jaymcor@mas.to](https://mas.to/@jaymcor)
* Post on your other social media accounts like facebook, twitter, etc
* Send emails as appropriate
* Also consider adding the link to appropriate web pages, etc

------------------------------------------------------------------

## Follow some interesting accounts

#### Easy way

* Whenever you see an interesting persona
  * perhaps in a boosted post
  * perhaps when perusing the local or federated feed
* You can click their name for more info and to follow
  * See what kind of things they post and how often

#### Manually

* Use the search box
  * you can type a name, e.g. 'James Corey'
  * or you can type username and server, e.g. `@jaymcor@mas.to`
  * click the "Follow" button next to the appropriate search result

#### Some interesting users

* [Astronomy Picture of the Day](https://botsin.space/@APoD) `@APoD@botsin.space`
* [The European Commission](https://social.network.europa.eu/@EU_Commission) `@EU_Commission@social.network.europa.eu`
* [George Takei](https://universeodon.com/@georgetakei) `@georgetakei@universeodon.com`
* [Jeff Tiedrich](https://mastodon.social/@jefftiedrich) `@jefftiedrich@mastodon.social`
* [Greta Thunberg](https://mastodon.nu/@gretathunberg) `@gretathunberg@mastodon.nu`
* [Neil Gaiman](https://mastodon.social/@neilhimself) `@neilhimself@mastodon.social`
* [Stephen Fry](https://mastodonapp.uk/@stephenfry) `@stephenfry@mastodonapp.uk`
* [Julia Evans](https://mastodon.social/@b0rk) `@b0rk@mastodon.social`
* [John Conway](https://sauropods.win/@john) `@john@sauropods.win`
* [Windell Oskay](https://mastodon.social/@oskay) `@oskay@mastodon.social`
* [Molly White](https://hachyderm.io/@molly0xfff) `@molly0xfff@hachyderm.io`
* [Matt Blaze](https://federate.social/@mattblaze) `@mattblaze@federate.social`

#### Provisos

* If somebody is posting too much, you can temporarily mute them
* If somebody is boosting too much, you can hide just their boosts
* Beware impersonation accounts
  * the linked website verification method is very helpful
    * if verification link checks, it is highlighted in green
  * comparing vs google search results for the name can be helpful
  * web of trust considerations apply
    * did you get the link from someone you have met?
    * how careful is that person?

------------------------------------------------------------------

## Write some things

* text
* images
* links
* polls
* audio
* video

#### Mentioning other users

* same server? `@jaymcor`
* different server? `@jaymcor@mas.to`

#### Hashtags

* please use them--helps people search and discover
* inline or collected at end
* don't go crazy
* CamelCase for clarity when appropriate
* but it's not case sensitive
* no hyphens just letters and numbers
* examples:
  * `#politics`
  * `#dinosaurs`
  * `#FollowFriday`
  * `#DogsOfMastodon`
  * `#CatsOfMastodon`
  * `#caturday`
  * `#lichensubscribe`
* find more examples by selecting Explore/Hashtags

#### Content warnings (CW)

* use for traditional sensitive content
* but also spoiler alerts, politics, ugly things like the TFG
* also can use for "below the fold"
  * perhaps to make skimming easier for the reader
* some community variations in usage

#### Provisos

* for now, do not assume your posts are truly private
  * even when you shared only with followers or an individual
  * they flow through the fediverse unencrypted
  * if secrecy is crucial, use a different tool
  * analogous to email

------------------------------------------------------------------

## Boost some things

* in other words re-posting or re-sharing
* no annotations--you can read [the rationale](https://mastodon.social/@Gargron/99662106175542726) if curious
* this is main way people discover new things and connect
* remember, people always have the option to hide your boosts if they like
* liking (the star) is nice but less crucial
  * lets the author know you appreciate their post
  * does not increase visibility
  * it's not a competition
