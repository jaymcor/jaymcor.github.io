# A Mastodon Quickstart

There's not much to it:

1. Choose a provider
2. Setup your profile
3. Follow some accounts or topics
4. Write some things
5. Boost some things
6. Repeat steps 3-6

There seem to be two typical roadbumps:

* Confusion over choosing a provider (step 1)
* Building connections (it's not automatic) (step 6)

------------------------------------------------------------------

## Right platform?

* Focusing here on [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/)
  * Most active platform in fediverse
  * Public discourse through short messages
  * "Microblogging"
* Other options in the fediverse
  * [PixelFed](https://pixelfed.org/): image sharing / gallery
  * [Funkwhale](https://funkwhale.audio/): audio streaming
  * [PeerTube](https://joinpeertube.org/en): p2p WebRTC sharing/chatting
  * [Pleroma](https://pleroma.social/): richer text with markdown
  * [Misskey](https://misskey.ai/): different microblogging
  * [WriteFreely](https://writefreely.org/): macroblogging
  * [Lots more options](https://fediverse.party/) interoperable in the [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse)
* Other proprietary options
  * Have you learned nothing?

------------------------------------------------------------------

## Choosing a server/community

* You **don't need to run your own server**
  * Unless you want to... not covered here
* Best bet: **just use the same server as your friends**
* **Doesn't much matter** which server you choose
  * Conceptually a big tree of nodes, all connected
  * You can communicate with anybody
  * You can move your account to a different provider any time
    * It's designed in... only takes a couple clicks

### Server recommendation help

The official [joinmastodon.org](https://joinmastodon.org/) page

* Provides a simple and easy interface
* Most people just use that

### Selection considerations for the connoisseur

You could just pick any reasonably large (1000+) server.

It will be fine.

But if you want to check more carefully, consider:

* **Up-to-date** software version
* Big&stable vs small&nimble
* **Which language**
* Server responsiveness
* Moderator responsiveness
* Max post text length (varies, often 500 chars)
* Local **code of conduct**
* Extra features
* Communities
  * Based on fields and interests
  * Based on identity
  * Based on location

### How to scrutinize a server / community

* Load the server's home page and click the "Local" feed link (or append `/public/local`)
  * There's at least something going on, right?
  * Evaluate the content subjectively...
  * Can you see a few interesting random posts?
  * Comfortable neighborhood?  What kind of people?
  * Right level of friendliness, intellectualism, etc?
* Read the server's about page (click about on lower left or append `/about`)
  * **Important**: can you abide the **code of conduct**?
  * Do the server rules offer the protections you want?
  * Do the server rules offer the freedoms you want?
  * Extra credit: sanity check moderated servers list...
    * Are there people or servers you want to follow that would be filtered?

------------------------------------------------------------------

## Setting up an account

#### Create an account

* Use the "Create" or "Sign up" button on the server home page
  * In some cases it's immediate
  * In other cases you have to go through hoops e.g. email ping
* Add profile pic
* Add sufficient info for disambiguation
* Add whatever personal info you wish to divulge
  * Abilities?
  * Sensitivities?
  * Proclivities?
  * Location?
  * Profession?
* Add links to websites

#### Post an introduction

It is common convention to introduce yourself via a post:

* Use the `#introduction` hashtag
* Additional hashtags might help with visibility
* Synopsis of personal info on your profile
* What sort of posts to expect from you
* Some exciting hook to convince people to follow you?
  * An interesting picture might help

#### Let your various contacts know your address

* `@me@some.server` in text, `https://some.server/@me` in link
  * E.g. <a href="https://mas.to/@jaymcor">@jaymcor@mas.to</a>
* Post on your other social media accounts like facebook, twitter, etc
* Send emails as appropriate
* Also consider adding the link to appropriate web pages, etc

------------------------------------------------------------------

## Follow some interesting accounts

You have to actively choose to follow people, otherwise your feed will
happily remain barren.

How barren or full is your preference.

There are tools for finding friends from twitter, if you're migrating.
Those are not documented here.

#### Easy way

* Whenever you see an interesting persona...
  * Perhaps from a boosted post
  * Perhaps when perusing the local or federated feed
* Click their name for more info, click follow
  * Have a look what kind of things they post and how often

#### Manually

* Use the search box
  * You can type a name, e.g. `James Corey`
  * Or you can type username and server, e.g. `@jaymcor@mas.to`
  * Click the "Follow" button next to the appropriate search result

#### Starter pack

You should definitely follow the admin for your server.

Below are some random starting points you might try...

* Institutional
  * [Fedi.Tips](https://mstdn.social/@feditips) `@feditips@mstdn.social`
  * [Astronomy Picture of the Day](https://botsin.space/@APoD) `@APoD@botsin.space`
  * [The European Commission](https://social.network.europa.eu/@EU_Commission) `@EU_Commission@social.network.europa.eu`
* 3 Random Famous people
  * [George Takei](https://universeodon.com/@georgetakei) `@georgetakei@universeodon.com`
  * [Greta Thunberg](https://mastodon.nu/@gretathunberg) `@gretathunberg@mastodon.nu`
  * [Neil Gaiman](https://mastodon.social/@neilhimself) `@neilhimself@mastodon.social`
* 3 Random Subject experts
  * [Jay Rosen](https://mastodon.social/@jayrosen_nyu) `@jayrosen_nyu@mastodon.social`
  * [Sheril Kirshenbaum](https://mastodon.social/@Sheril) `@Sheril@mastodon.social`
  * [Matt Blaze](https://federate.social/@mattblaze) `@mattblaze@federate.social`

#### Hashtags

Yes, you can follow hashtags, just enter them in search or explore, open the feed, and hit the plus icon at the top.

* `#BreadPosting`
* `#lichensubscribe`
* `#caturday`

#### Please note

* If somebody is posting too much, you can temporarily mute them
* If somebody is boosting too much, you can hide just their boosts
* Beware impersonation accounts
  * The linked website verification method is very helpful
    * If verification checks, it is highlighted in green
  * Compare vs google search results for the name if in doubt
  * Web of trust considerations apply
    * Did you get the link from someone you know IRL?
    * How careful is that person?

------------------------------------------------------------------

## Write some things

* Text
* Images
* Links
* Polls
* Audio
* Video

#### Mentioning other users

* Same server? `@jaymcor`
* Different server? `@jaymcor@mas.to`

#### Hashtags

* Use them!  It helps people search and discover
* Inline or collected at end
* Don't go crazy
* CamelCase for clarity when appropriate
* But it's not case sensitive
* No hyphens just letters and numbers
* Examples:
  * `#politics`
  * `#FollowFriday`
  * `#sporespondence`
* Find more examples by selecting Explore/Hashtags

#### Content warnings (CW)

* Use for traditional sensitive content
* But also for spoiler alerts, politics, ugly things like TFG
* Also can use for "below the fold"
  * Perhaps to make skimming easier for the reader
* Some community variations in usage

#### Provisos

* For now, do not assume your posts are truly private
  * Even when you shared only with followers or an individual
  * They flow through the fediverse unencrypted
  * If secrecy is crucial, use a different tool
  * Analogous to email

------------------------------------------------------------------

## Boost some things

* In other words re-posting or re-sharing
* No annotations--you can read [the rationale](https://mastodon.social/@Gargron/99662106175542726) if curious
* This is main way people discover new stuff and connect
* Remember, people always have the option to hide your boosts if they like
* Liking (the star) is nice but less crucial
  * It lets the author know you appreciate their post
  * But it does not increase visibility
  * It's not a competition
