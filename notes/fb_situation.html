<h2 id="irony">Irony</h2>
<p>The day before I wrote this, <strong>I was just defending
Facebook</strong>. There had been some disinformation which claimed they
had banned a thing they clearly had not banned, and would likely never
ban. I pointed out that the disinformation had already been addressed by
snopes and other sites, and should never have been taken seriously
without credible evidence. I provided references for clarity.</p>
<p>Absurdly, the disinformation itself was being distributed via
Facebook, including a copy of the thing that was purported to be banned.
Everything about it was dumb, that’s probably the best summary.</p>
<p>Note, not a complete vindication of Facebook, just that they were
blameless on that specific occasion.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="general-malaise">General Malaise</h2>
<p>I’ve often complained in the past about Facebook’s product quality
issues around UX, reliability and trustworthiness, but I tend to just
put up with it.</p>
<p>The fact that you can’t control what might appear in your feed or in
what order means that you can never be sure you’ve seen what your
friends wrote, or whether a thing in your feed is from who it purports
to be from, or avoid seeing disinformation, incendiary content, or just
ads that the AI chooses to mix in. So their basic premise requires the
<strong>complete erosion of trust</strong>.</p>
<p>There’s no point in me rehashing all my complaints here, especially
since I evidently was willing to put up with it.</p>
<p>Like many, I complain, but am a creature of habit, too lazy to
change, and not wanting to abandon the network of friends who are also
using the platform. The vendor lock-in problem is naturally the ultimate
cause of the anti-competitive landscape that has led to these annoying
quality issues. At times I’m less active, at times I take take a hiatus,
but I generally return.</p>
<p>From time to time, friends have told me about <strong>strange
administrative actions</strong> taken against them, and I’ve paid
attention but tried not to over-react. It’s concerning, but I like to
think of myself as patient and open-minded…</p>

<h2 id="something-i-care-about">Something I Care About</h2>
<p>On August 11 2023, some corrupt small town officials in Marion county
Kansas engaged in a punitive raid of a local newspaper, resulting in the
death of the 98-year-old co-owner, Joan Meyer.</p>
<p>I think of it as a morality litmus test. If it doesn’t bother you,
then your psyche needs some TLC. We all do. I’m happy to chat about
it.</p>
<p>The particular incident was reported widely. I posted a link, to one
of the articles on the subject, on August 12 2023.</p>
<p>On April 4 2024, I received the following notice from Facebook,
stating that my post on the subject had been removed, and claiming I had
violated their community standards:</p>
<p><img src="../images/fb_explanation.png" /></p>
<p>If there had been a gray issue, I would perhaps have checked myself
and been thankful for the feedback. It wasn’t.</p>
<p>I double-checked that the newspaper article I linked was still valid,
did not seem to contain any surprises, and that no major news had
changed the nature of the dialogue in any way that could warrant such a
takedown.</p>
<p>I don’t think it violates community standards. The problem does not
seem to be with my post. Rather, this is perhaps the most egregious form
of corporate censorship–not even born of dogmatic policy or confused
hysteria, but of abject mediocrity.</p>
<p>It may well be that there is some person or small business
specializing in social media manipulation and/or reputation repair,
trying to remove references to news of that particular incident,
possibly on behalf of the very same perpetrators. But that should not be
allowed, as it confirms their idea that they can use unscrupulous means
to get away with whatever they desire. Yet it seems this sort of
practice is business as usual.</p>
<p>Ultimately it does not matter how exactly it is happening. I don’t
mean to say that any person employed by Meta Platforms, Inc is
deliberately abetting these crimes. Nor should the failings of one set
of individuals condemn the entire company. However, I believe that,
<strong>by leaving their automated moderation systems in a broken,
inaccurate, and easily misused state, Facebook is, at the very least,
indirectly abetting fraudsters and manipulators</strong>–through
negligence and incompetence.</p>
<p>And now that it has been brought so directly to my attention, it
seems to me that I should not support that. I believe my
<strong>recourse is to take my business elsewhere</strong>. I won’t miss
the ads or deliberate blurring of authentic and inauthentic content.</p>

<h2 id="going-forward">Going Forward</h2>
<p>I will stop using Facebook until the situation improves.</p>
<p>I will emphasize free, open, and distributed systems such as the
fediverse.</p>
<p>I don’t want to just jump from one corporate walled garden to
another. Although I may have friends who feel attached to WeChat,
WhatsApp, etc, I want to avoid going down the same road with other
proprietary solutions that don’t prioritize the interests of users.</p>
<p>Goals in prioritized order:</p>
<ul>
<li>platform itself is known to be trustworthy</li>
<li>cryptographic securing of identity</li>
<li>good performance and not too buggy</li>
<li>available on both web browser and phone app</li>
<li>easy enough for non-technical users</li>
<li>good moderation, transparent administration</li>
<li>respect user’s time and subscription preferences</li>
<li>no lock-in, ideally</li>
<li>free–no way I’m going to force someone else to pay $</li>
<li>UI not too bad</li>
<li>the more flexible the better</li>
</ul>
<p>What I considered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mastodon (well known)</li>
<li>Matrix.org / Element (well known)</li>
<li>Diaspora (makes you send email requesting an invite, then says $8.
Ruby.)</li>
<li>WriteFreely / Write.as (costs for hosted version. Go.)</li>
<li>Plume (unmaintained. Rust.)</li>
<li>Misskey (unstable–misskey.ai gone, weird interface, hard to
recommend. Typescript.)</li>
<li>Friendica (seems OK, you have to fill in a form and wait for
approval. PHP.)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="public-discussions">Public Discussions</h3>
<p>Additional public forum goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>public posts viewable by public without creating any kind of
account</li>
<li>ideally can delete and/or block comments on my own posts</li>
<li>bad actors banned quickly</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ll <strong>continue using my existing Mastodon account</strong> (<a
href="https://mastodon.acm.org/@jaymcor"><span class="citation"
data-cites="jaymcor">@jaymcor</span><span class="citation"
data-cites="mastodon.acm.org">@mastodon.acm.org</span></a>) for public
discussion, sharing, reposting, and such, with a little less worry about
over-posting. But I will lean on boosting, so that if somebody is only
marginally interested in following, they can just mute the boosts.</p>
<p>Since Mastodon is typically limited to short and simple posts, for
long posts or reference material of permanent interest, I will use
something separate. While I am comfortable writing markdown and
generating HTML pages (at jaymcor.github.io), I would prefer to use
something that I can recommend for non-technical users, such as
Diaspora. However, since I can not find a good recommendation, I’ll just
do my long-format posts the old-fashioned way for now and link them from
Mastodon.</p>
<p>See <a href="mastodon_quickstart.html">my quickstart guide</a> for
help with Mastodon.</p>
<h3 id="private-conversations-with-friends-and-close-friends">Private
Conversations with Friends and Close Friends</h3>
<p>Additional private chatroom goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>encrypted</li>
<li>quick and easy to create account</li>
<li>group ownership and/or asymmetric trust</li>
</ul>
<p>For private communication it will be crucial for the other party to
have a trusted identity, and preferably cryptographic keys. In my
opinion, it is generally a mistake to try to remember that a seemingly
private conversation is less private than it looks. Humans are bad at
detecting tiny security errors that can have big consequences. So it is
better to use a platform for private conversations that is encrypted by
default.</p>
<p>It seems like <strong>matrix.org is the main open encrypted option
available</strong> currently.</p>
<p>My address there is <a
href="https://matrix.to/#/@jaymcor:matrix.org"><span class="citation"
data-cites="jaymcor:matrix.org">@jaymcor:matrix.org</span></a>.</p>
<p>For (at most) a couple dozen close friends whom I trust strongly,
have met in real life, have known for many years, whose identity I have
verified, and with whom I am willing to share more detailed information
about my private life, I will maintain a group of closest friends. Less
public updates will go to there. Any important public updates about
myself, sent to the public Mastodon group, will also be mirrored
here.</p>
<p>The matrix.org system was comfortable and easy to get stuff done,
passed all my basic testing, so I think I can recommend that to other
people.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://matrix.org">matrix.org</a> for creating new
accounts–it’s pretty easy, probably no need for me to write any special
instructions for that.</p>
