<h1 id="notes-some-popular-covid-19-antivax-misinformation">Notes: Some
Popular COVID-19 Antivax Misinformation</h1>
<hr />
<h2 id="context">Context</h2>
<p>I received a sample of misinformation on wechat. It was convincing
enough that I had friends who were worried by it.</p>
<p><img src="../images/antivax_screenshot.png" /></p>
<p>This is my attempt to debunk the particular vaccine misinformation.
Unfortunately it also mentions politics. I do not know why they should
be intertwined, but in this case they are.</p>
<p>I’m not going to link to the actual video.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The recording seems to be a small discussion on the subject of
freedom (from vaccines) on June 9 2023, held at the behest of Senator
Doug Mastriano, hosted in a federal building in Washington DC, but
(clearly) not attended by many.</p>
<p>In order to better understand the context of the discussion panel, it
is worth delving into the people present at the panel, their shared
interests and biases, starting with their leader, and also some details
about the speaker during the video in question.</p>
<p>You might imagine that the panel was an investigation into evidence
and discussion on the pros and cons of the vaccine, lessons learned,
etc, but the list of invited speakers suggests a more narrow
purpose.</p>

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s see who Doug invited.</p>
<p>Thomas Renz: a lawyer specializing in challenging COVID-19
quarantines, mask mandates, and vaccine requirements. He has a right
wing talk show, thinks that COVID-19 is an attempt to influence the
election. Promises to englighten his listeners about all the lies told
by “mainstream media.”</p>
<p>Steve Kirsh: an entrepreneur who was briefly involved in pushing a
blockchain startup, before the company disassociated themselves due to
his controversial involvement in COVID-19 vaccine misinformation, such
as saying the vaccine interferes with fertility and kills twice as many
people as it saves, which experts assure is unsubstantiated and
demonstrably incorrect.</p>
<p>Graham Hetrick: a county official who played a coroner on TV, and
likes to use pictures of himself on the TV show as background when
encouraging people not to wear masks and to avoid vaccines. Says God has
vaccinated him. But he has some sort of affiliation with Harrisburg
University, again in the field of cadaver disection and other coronary
duties. His advice for COVID-19 is mainly about deep breathing, and to
remember that whatever doesn’t kill you makes you stronger (this is not
true).</p>
<p>Peter McCullough: the guy in the video</p>
<ul>
<li>degree from Baylor U (a private christian university), now at Texas
A&amp;M</li>
<li>biggest name in COVID-19 misinformation</li>
<li>turns out Baylor U sued to keep him from associating himself with
them</li>
<li>he’s the guy in the infamous Joe Rogan antivax episode (hosted by
Spotify)
<ul>
<li>a number of musicians left Spotify to protest the harm caused by
this</li>
</ul></li>
<li>long history of COVID-19 misinformation
<ul>
<li>claimed only people over 50 needed to worry about COVID-19</li>
<li>claimed only people over 30 needed to worry about COVID-19</li>
<li>claimed the vaccine was killing large numbers of people</li>
<li>said there was no asymptomatic spread of COVID-19</li>
<li>strongly advocated HCQ and ivermectin as COVID-19 treatments
<ul>
<li>despite evidence they were more harmful than helpful for
COVID-19</li>
<li>claimed the authorities were suppressing the truth of HCQ
effectiveness</li>
</ul></li>
<li>claimed that survivors could not be re-infected</li>
<li>claimed the virus was planned and engineered</li>
<li>claimed “spike protein” kills cells and causes death</li>
</ul></li>
<li>tends to testify for far-right “hearings” on COVID-19 e.g. by Ron
Johnson</li>
<li>his game is to snow people with reputation and terminology</li>
<li>his arguments have been discredited</li>
<li>COVID-19 disinfo is his main claim to fame, but he also sells
supplements</li>
</ul>
<p>Some people would say this context is sufficient to conclude the
discussion. It’s not that such a panel is incapable of saying something
useful or truthful, but probably if there are important truths to be
uncovered, we can rest assured they will eventually find their way via
trustworthy channels.</p>
<p>But still, for those who have watched the video, here is a
critique.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-contents">The Contents</h2>
<p>Opens with several minutes of McCullough pontificating about his
credibility for the audience. Which is to say, not the people present at
that time (just stooges and video production help), but rather the
people who will later watch the video on social media. Normally one’s
credibility should be established by commendation from an independent
trusted authority, rather than one’s own defensive ramblings. Worst yet,
he finally leads into his presentation by quoting “evidence” from an
op-ed piece he himself wrote (op-eds are space-filler meant to generate
reactions, neither vetted nor meant to be confused with news).</p>
<p>He uses a lot of phrases that establish him as a conspiracy theorist,
such as describing COVID-19 as “devised in a Chinese bio-security lab”
which sounds impressive, when it flies by at high speed and you don’t
have enough time to think about the confusion of the phrase let alone
the idea. But as a reminder, Sars-Cov-2 is a frightfully normal and
natural crossover virus. There has never been any convincing evidence
that it is man-made. It is also natural that any such viruses are
investigated in secure virology labs. He talks about Big Pharma, making
sure to set the tone for listener distrust of “mainstream medicine.” He
is shocked that Only Now, 4 years after the fact, is congress hearing
from physicians. That would be surprising, but it’s also false. It’s not
even his first time pushing this particular narrative in front of
congress. And again, the panel is anything but a neutral venue for
listening to physicians. As for whether he is Only Now being taken
seriously, it’s quite the opposite from my understanding… far right
backers notwithstanding.</p>
<p>He talks about the vaccine “installing the genetic code for the
lethal part of the virus” (by which he means the S protein that binds to
ACE-2 receptors, a characteristic of coronaviruses). This is not some
kind of exotic retrovirus. mRNA translation does not change fundamental
DNA, nor does the mRNA linger indefinitely. He claims mRNA vaccines have
never been tested before. But actually, Shingrix vaccines use the same
technology and have been widespread since 2017 or earlier. It replaced
the earlier vaccine because it is more effective and has fewer side
effects. It is recommended for older adults or those with weak immune
systems. 6 million doses were administered in 2019 in America, with no
major political debacle, probably because it was never politicized.</p>
<p>He claims nobody knows how long the mRNA strands remain in the body
synthesizing the “lethal spike proteins” (the S proteins). Clearly this
is about taking a slang term “spike protein” that sounds vaguely
menacing, and playing it up. Yes, mRNA vaccines use the body to produce
these characteristic antigens, rather than directly dumping large
amounts of them into the blood as a traditional vaccine must. The mRNA
vaccines are actually safer in this regard. A high concentration of
antigen is needed in the short term for the sake of training the immune
system. The spike proteins by themselves are not dangerous in the way
the COVID-19 virus is. It’s more analogous to a separated body part of a
soldier who would be menacing if whole. Of course it has been studied,
and the studies have found them to be relatively harmless, and much
fewer in concentration compared with what happens if you get sick with
COVID-19. This antigen was chosen to be safe but effective for the
purpose of reliable immune recognition. It’s also false that nobody
knows how long the vaccine’s mRNA strands remain in the cytoplasm
causing ribosomes to produce the characteristic antigen. Tests have
shown production peaks at 9 days and is attenuated by a factor of 1000
after the 9th day, continuing to fade until no longer present. Experts
further claim that the references cited by McCullough have been
misinterpreted by him and don’t support his conclusions, and that there
is no credible evidence for long term persistence of the mRNA strands
and resulting antigens. It’s like he has no concept of how one might go
about designing a modern vaccine with a particular mRNA lifetime.
Actually he probably doesn’t. I certainly don’t, but I can imagine.
Presumably his viewers don’t.</p>
<p>He talks about the risk of myocarditis without mentioning that the
risk is orders of magnitude higher when infected with COVID-19 and is
more commonly associated with the latter. He asserts that 100% of deaths
that occur after vaccination involve myocarditis, but this is based on
biased exploration of a sample of 28 cases, and the paper (which he
cowrote) was not peer reviewed. However, many experts say it’s chock
full of confusion. (there is more on that in the links below).</p>
<p>Well, that’s probably enough for now. I am not claiming to be an
expert.</p>
<p>Parting thought: misinformation here can cause confusion all around
the world.</p>
