<h1 id="more-mastadon-tips-trivia">More Mastadon Tips &amp; Trivia</h1>
<hr />
<h2 id="narrow-mode">Narrow mode</h2>
<p>If you have your monitor vertically oriented, it seems to automatically switch into a “mobile” style layout where the left column is dropped. Looks much better in my opinion.</p>
<h3 id="what-about-searching">What about searching?</h3>
<p>But where did the search box go?</p>
<p>You don’t need it, you can click on <em>Explore</em> on the right column and search from there.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="following-a-hashtag">Following a hashtag</h2>
<p>Be aware that some of the popular hashtags can have quite a few posts, and it might be more than you’d want to wade through on a daily basis. That said, you just need to search for the hashtag (e.g. under the Explore window), select the hashtag to view it, and then click the little + box in the upper right hand corner.</p>

</figure>
<p>Not every phone app knows how to follow hashtags. Tusky supports it. At time of writing, the official Mastodon app didn’t seem to support it. However it works with the Mastodon PWA (see below for instructions).</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="mobile-apps">Mobile apps</h2>
<h3 id="any-phone">Any phone</h3>
<p>There’s a PWA, so you get an experience similar to the browser one. It’s pretty good on mobile devices, definitely worth installing. You can have it installed simultaneously with whatever other app.</p>
<p>Just use your phone’s web browser to open your server’s home page (in my case https://mas.to/home) like you would on the desktop, then tell it to install the PWA on the phone, which will provide yet another “app” icon for accessing Mastodon on your phone.</p>
<h3 id="android">Android</h3>
<p>There are a bunch of options, here’s what I’ve tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Official Mastadon App</li>
<li>Tusky</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m currently using Tusky because I’m happy that the developer pissed off the fascists by being so eager to quelch them on his app at the drop of the hat, so now they seem to be angrily pushing FUD against Tusky. If the fascists are unhappy, that’s a sign of doing something right.</p>
<h3 id="iphone">Iphone</h3>
<p>There are a bunch, haven’t tried them.</p>
<ul>
<li>MetaText is apparently quite popular</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="verified-links">Verified Links</h2>
<h3 id="why">Why</h3>
<p>Because accounts can be easily impersonated.</p>
<h3 id="embedded-link">Embedded Link</h3>
<p>Under your preferences/profile, link to some well known sites that people independently know as you. If that site has an appropriate link leading back to your Mastodon profile, then the link will be highlighted in green and given a checkmark.</p>
<p>In theory, it’s as simple as embedding the following code in an external link that you control:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;a rel=&quot;me&quot; href=&quot;https://mas.to/@jaymcor&quot;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
<p>However, sometimes you don’t have access to raw HTML, or it gets modified by the system you’re linking to.</p>
<h4 id="linkedin">LinkedIn</h4>
<p>I have not yet found a way to make it work.</p>
<p>DM me at <code>@jaymcor@mas.to</code> if you figure out how.</p>
<h4 id="facebook">Facebook</h4>
<p>I have not yet found a way to make it work.</p>
<p>Surprisingly frustrating, navigating the labyrinth hoping for a way to just update my profile to show a simple external contact URL. DM me at <code>@jaymcor@mas.to</code> if you figure out how.</p>
<h4 id="github">GitHub</h4>
<p>Mostly github wants to remove the <code>rel="me"</code> part, but there is a way.</p>
<p>Create a user repo, e.g. <code>jaymcor.github.io</code> and add your own raw <code>index.html</code>…</p>
<h3 id="fediverse">Fediverse</h3>
<p>It just works, linking to other fediverse accounts.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="moving-from-one-server-to-another">Moving from one server to another</h2>
<h3 id="why-1">Why</h3>
<ul>
<li>new server is more fitting</li>
<li>old server has a problem</li>
<li>to taste the freedom</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-happens">What happens?</h3>
<p>You move most of your data including past posts, the list of things you follow, local filters, bookmarks, etc.</p>
<p><strong>You get to choose</strong> whether followers of your old address will automatically be switched to point at your new address (in most cases you should do it).</p>
<h3 id="how">How</h3>
<p>There’s a process, it has to be done in a particular order</p>
<ul>
<li>On old server, export your data
<ul>
<li>Note that your “Archive” includes your liked posts, stuff you posted, etc</li>
<li>You’ll want to separately download the CSV for follows, blocks, mutes, etc</li>
<li>Your bookmarks are available as separate CSV but also included in archive</li>
</ul></li>
<li>On new server, create the new account
<ul>
<li>Make the new account profile page look the way you want now</li>
<li>Pretend you’re a counterfeiter–duplicate the following
<ul>
<li>profile avatar pic</li>
<li>profile header pic</li>
<li>bio</li>
<li>verified links</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Basic preferences e.g. “slow mode”, themes, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>On new server, goto Prefs/Account/MovingFrom and set old address as alias to new</li>
<li>On old server, goto Prefs/Account/MovingTo, put new address, old password</li>
<li>On new server, restore data as needed</li>
</ul>
<p>Check <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/moving/">the official docs</a> for an authoritative guide.</p>
<p><strong>Note: at time of writing (2022-12-26) you still need to manually recreate the details in your profile, e.g. profile pic, bio, etc. When you start the <code>MovingTo</code> process, the old account will be dimmed/disabled and will refer people to the new one, so best to finish exporting data, copying profile, and anything else you need with the old account, before you begin the <code>MovingTo</code> step.</strong></p>
